# go-paillier

This library is an implementation of the [Paillier cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem) which is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. It has homomorphic properties; ie. multiplying two ciphertexts decrypts to the sum of their plaintexts. This property is leveraged for threshold ECDSA.
